# LineaRegression - Ecommerce

This notebook studies the dataset to determine if a company has to invest in Web development or App development. 
The attributes considered to make this decision are:
1. Avg. Session Length	
2. Time on App	
3. Time on Website	
4. Length of Membership	
5. Yearly Amount Spent

Performed regression analysis and concluded:
1. Membership time period has the highest impact on the sales.
2. Company should invest more on mobile app developement than the web app development.



# Classification - DiseasePrediction

This notebook is focused on how to pre-process any text documents. 

1. Explored various NLTK libraries for text cleaning and preprocessing like tokenizer and Proter Stemmer.
2. Defining Sparse Data structure: **CSR Matrix** 
3. **Feature Extraction:** Implemented Bag Of words technique using Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer
4. Understood the concept of **similarity and distances**. Implemented Cosine Similarity
5. Implemented **Custom K-Nearest Neighbour** algorithm using cosine similarity
6. Understood concept of Accuracy, Recall, precision and F1-score.

# TimeSeriesAnalysis - AirPassenger

The intend of this project is to understand Time Series Analysis. 
I learned:

1. Learned the concept of Stationarity, Trend, Seasonality, Cycles, Variations and Irregularities in a time series
2. Performed **hypothesis testing, Stationarity Check using Dickey Fuller test  and  Seasonality Decomposition.**
3. Explored **AIRMA model, ACF Plots and PACF plots**
4. Defined following statistical terms based on real world dataset.</br>
   <ul>
   <li> <b>Mean:</b> Representation of a group. Center value of a dataset. </br>
                 Preferred when data is symmetrical </br>  </li>
   <li> <b>Median:</b> The middle value in an ordered list </br>
                 Preferred when data is skewed. </br> </li>
   <li> <b>Variance:</b> What are the ranges in the dataset. </br> 
                 Do we have skewed data or skinny ranges? </br> </li>
   <li> <b>Standard Deviation:</b> By how much the data is spreaded.</br> </li>
   <li> <b>Correlation:</b> How two things are related wrt each other. </br> 
                 Ranges from -1 to 1. -1 co related in opposite direction, </br>
                 0 not correlated at all.</br> </li>
   <li> We can quantify the strength and type of relationship between observations and their lags.</br> </li>
   <li> Autocorrelation plots are also a commonly-used tool for checking randomness in a data set. </li>
   <li> <b>Covariance:</b> Two random variables are changing similarly. If one is increasing the other is also increasing. The same goes with lesser.</li>
 </ul>
